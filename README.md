# Availability-Attacks-Create-Shortcuts

Code for KDD 2022 Research Track paper ["Availability Attacks Create Shortcuts"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00898).

This code is tested with python3 and PyTorch 1.8. 

Please first install the following packages:

    scikit-learn, torch, numpy
    
The code for testing the linear separability of existing availability attacks are in the `perturbations_are_linear_separable` folder. The code for testing synthetic shortcuts as availability attacks are in the `synthetic_perturbations` folder.
